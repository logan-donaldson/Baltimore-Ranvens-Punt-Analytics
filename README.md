# Baltimore-Ravens-Punt-Analytics
In collaboration with the Baltimore Ravens my research team was tasked with gleaning interesting insights about punts in the NFL from a proprietary play-by-play data set courtesy of PFF.

My focus for the project was creating a linear regression model to predict the length of NFL punt returns. The mathematical methodology and code can be found in the R markdown file as well as either the html or PDF output. A concise summary can be found in the introduction, figure 1, and figure 4 portions of the poster file.
